# template_ETL_repo
This repo is used as the template when creating new repository.

## What is inside the template
1. Issue template (.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/*.md)
2. Pull Request template (.github/PULL_REQUEST_TEMPLATE.md)
3. Skeleton Folders
4. Python requirements (environment_*.yml) ([pls use conda to install](https://docs.conda.io/projects/conda/en/latest/user-guide/tasks/manage-environments.html#creating-an-environment-from-an-environment-yml-file))

## Steps to create new repo using template:
1. Create new repository or simply click the button "Use this template"
2. Select this repo from "Repository template"
3. Copy from [here](https://github.com/sfbrigade/data-science-wg/blob/master/dswg_project_resources/Project-README-template.md) paste and edit the followings as your `readme.md` in root folder


## GitHub Actions - host dbt docs on website (Reusable workflow)

https://www.youtube.com/watch?app=desktop&v=I-yT2Err6PE&feature=youtu.be

1.  Create a ci.yml file
2.  If it is self-hosted, the deploy site will be generated automatically
3.  Otherwise, go settings > pages
    Source: deploy from a branch
    Branch: gh-pages - /(root)
    Then, the build and deploy workflow will start automatically


```yaml
